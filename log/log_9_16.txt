Zane Meikle:
This week we finished the CONOPS report, downloaded python and printed helloworld, and I looked into 
pynput.mouse for controlling the mouse via python. My personal plan from here is to start testing 
controlling the mouse via pynput.mouse and then looking into how to sync that up with the updates 
from the sensor.

Oscar Chavez Araiza:
This week we finished the CONOPS report and researched more about ML. I have narrowed down the model 
selection to CNN(Convolutional neural network). This model will allow me to blend the computer vision 
model with a radar-based approach. This means that the AI model will take knowledge from previous 
models.


Greyson Heath:
This past week we finished writing our CONOPS. We also had a meeting with our sponsor (Nick) and 
cleared up some more confusion regarding the setup and orientation of the boards sent to us from TI. 
We had received the DCA1000 and mmwaveICboost boards, but lacked the actual radar board (IWR6843AOPEVM) 
until it arrived later last week. This week I plan on configuring the boards and running the “out-of-box” 
demo for the IWR6843 to understand TI’s software and how the radar interacts with our environment. 
Following this setup, I will be able to see how the data is outputted and work on researching and 
“trial-and-erroring” an adequate chirp configuration to detect our hand.

Daniel Lu:
A 3D-human-tracking case of the radar project will be run this week. I will do research on the example 
code provided by TI. I will ask questions about the math and code application on plot generating.
