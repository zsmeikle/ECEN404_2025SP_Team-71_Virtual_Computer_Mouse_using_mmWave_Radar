Zane Meikle: I fixed up and polished the mouse frame gen code, and will begin integrating.

Oscar Chavez: TI got back to me about the gesture binary, and stated that the angle data that was 
produced by the binary was based on angle bins, and would have to be converted back to actual angles. 
I could not find where the bins were created, so I’ll follow up with them. I also worked on the movement 
script, and found out that the radar “breaks” if you move your hand and it has a low velocity threshold.

Greyson Heath: Almost done modelling CAD changes to case, planning on printing when finished. Currently 
integrating GUI with current team code.

Daniel Lu: fixed the moving position error with geo measurements.
