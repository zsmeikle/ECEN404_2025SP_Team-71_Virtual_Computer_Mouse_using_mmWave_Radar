Zane Meikle: We have been discussing how to move forward with our project in terms of technical merit 
and are waiting to have a meeting tomorrow with our sponsor to finalize plans. For now the tentative 
plan is to move forward with integrating everything then going from there.

Oscar Chavez: I have updated github and added the CNN Keras model, and Scaler in my branch. I have also 
started looking for a suitable 3D model to contain the radar module if needed.

Greyson Heath: Our group has been discussing ideas to increase the technical merit of our project after
the successful integration of all subsystems. Tomorrow, we will speak with our Texas Instruments 
sponsor to address any unforeseen issues with our plans moving forward at this time.
