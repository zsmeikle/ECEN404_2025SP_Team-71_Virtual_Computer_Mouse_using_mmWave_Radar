Zane Meikle: We got the mouse to move via the radar and we are now getting both the gesture
and movement to work at the same time.

Oscar Chavez: We had another version issue with python, so I had to change versions from
python 3.12 to python 3.8. We got the code running again and the responsiveness did not
change. We also had a meeting with our sponsor, and he told us he wanted us to reduce the
size even more by removing the mmWaveICBOOST. This will reduce the size by a factor of 3.

Greyson Heath: As Zane mentioned, great progress on the “first-viable-product”. Planning to
see if we can eliminate the mmwaveicboost and only use the IWR6843 (smaller in area).

Daniel Lu: Both gesture and movement demo worked perfect with each other, but the moving
path is not as smooth as the “real” mouse.
