Zane Meikle:  
I worked on the presentation slides and the midterm report with the team mainly over the 
last week as it has taken up a lot of time. I am now focusing on the Subsystem Intro project as 
Dr. Lusher has been pushing us to focus on that, I should be done by the end of the lab.



Greyson Heath: 
Meeting with Nick on 9/18, discussed the com port errors experienced with OOB demo for 
only IWR6843 (no mmwaveicboost). Also discussed potential plan for if my technical merit was lacking. 
Worked on midterm report and presentation over the weekend with the team. Barrel connector to power 
mmwaveicboost should have arrived on Friday - it was not in my mailbox. Contacted amazon support, 
received a refund, and re-ordered it to a different address, and it should be coming on Tuesday, 9/24.


Oscar Chavez: 
Meeting with Nick on 9/18, talked about the best IDE for the ML program, 
worked on the FSR and ICD with the team, and worked on the intro project. I had a few issues with the

of the intro project.
