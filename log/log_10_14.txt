Zane Meikle: 
Since last update we have gone over what we needed to update Dr. Lusher with and talked with him to 
update him on the issues with the radar.
I plan to work on connecting matlab and python together and start on making a test program.

This week we worked on getting the scope of the project updated. After the last update meeting I was 
researching if the project was still viable. We were unable to find any signs that the original scope 
was possible.
We updated lusher on the situation and updated our sponsor on the current status of the project. We 
just got confirmation that we are no longer required to do 10-15ft. We are now working on a smaller 
range of about 1ft.
Since we got confirmation that we’ll be using a shorter range I will focus on optimizing the gesture 
recognition code by removing gestures we won’t use. If I can accomplish this task I’ll obtain training data.

The basic structure of the positioning code is created, waiting for validation and test.
Working with Greyson to construct the format of the output data.
We talked with Dr Lusher about the improvement of our device.

I experimented more with the ML Gesture bin file and OOB demo, and created a script that pulls the live 
data from the UART port. This data is in binary, and now I plan to ‘decode’ it into a useable format for 
the next subsystems.
Now that we have confirmation from our sponsor to work with the shorter range, I will continue with the 
plans listed above (now that I know time and resources will not be wasted on that).
