Zane Meikle: 
- I tried to get matlab and python to communicate but ran into issues so we decided to move everything 
to python.
- I’m going to work on implementing the testing program within the file itself.

Oscar Chavez:
Worked on getting the radar modules on my computer (4 hours)
Helped Greyson create code to get parsed data from the radar (1 hour)
Communicated with TI. Had our project been reworked we are using two radars with a max range of .5m. (1 hour)
I’m waiting on ML re-training documentation. I’m gonna send a follow up email since it’s been almost a 
week since I was promised the files.


Greyson Heath: After meeting with TI and confirming the change of scope, we have now decided to use two 
radars. One radar will be flashed with a program that will track the hand and send in data for the mouse 
position, and the other radar will be flashed with a separate program that will pickup the gestures for 
the actions (left click, right click). Working on solidifying a data parser for both devices.

Daniel Lu: I did research on k mean clustering and find this math application can increase the accuracy 
of the gesture positioning data. The k mean clustering will be used in my final demo.
