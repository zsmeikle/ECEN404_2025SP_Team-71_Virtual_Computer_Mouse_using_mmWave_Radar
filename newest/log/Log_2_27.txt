Oscar Chavez: Made a movement visualizer to help with smoothing out the movement of the mouse. 
Also made a script to try to get the position of the hand from the gesture angle data.
Made code to move the radar to a relative position based on position data instead of velocities.

Zane Meikle: last week we managed to get minecraft to work and tested the mouse on Argio, there we 
had some issues with accuracy so we assigned daniel to work on it and gave the frame gen to me, which 
I am working on now.

Greyson Heath: Completed CAD enclosure model for just the radar device. Plan on working as a team to 
figure out the best way to combine the devices or separate them. Working on GUI in the meantime.

Daniel Lu: Construct a new moving demo responding faster to the change in direction of the mouse
