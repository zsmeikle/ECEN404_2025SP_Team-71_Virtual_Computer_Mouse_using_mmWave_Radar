Zane Meikle: We met with TI and they agreed with our plan and gave us the suggestion of possibly 
reducing the number of radars later. Currently we are continuing to work on actually integrating code.

Daniel Lu:	 Prepare for the presentation
		 Meeting with TI and make agreement on future plan
		 Working on gathering our demos into one demo to test

Greyson Heath: Reviewed the TI sponsor meeting, and worked on the initial presentation. As of now, 
we are continuing forward with two radars to obtain a working prototype. Worked on constructing a 
3D model for a case for both radar devices, and experimented with Tkinter (python package) to create 
a GUI for our software.

Oscar Chavez: Met with TI, he agreed that we should add more gestures to improve the mouse control. 
He also stated that it would be a great improvement if we could reduce the number of radars used. Iâ€™ve 
been working on integrating the code together.
