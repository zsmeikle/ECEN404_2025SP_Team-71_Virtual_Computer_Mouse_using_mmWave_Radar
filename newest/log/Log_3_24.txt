Zane Meikle: Me and Greyson worked on integrating our parts last time and decided it would be better for 
all of us to integrate together which we are doing now.

Greyson Heath: Finished designing and printing final case model and lever to hold on computer- it works. 
Adding a few new settings to GUI and awaiting for Oscar/Daniel to finish their new integration to 
implement.


Oscar: I worked on finding a better configuration for the radar in order to get better, less noisy, data 
out of the radar. I also had a in-person meeting with our sponsor where we showed the functionality of 
the mouse.

Daniel Lu: Finishing the final moving position demo for the mouse. Try to improve the limit of use in 
distance
