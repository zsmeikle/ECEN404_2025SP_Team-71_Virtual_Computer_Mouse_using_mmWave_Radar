Zane Meikle: I wrote the initial function for the frame gen program, it works but there is an error 
where the child process isnâ€™t killing itself. I fixed that problem this morning and am now polishing 
the code.

Greyson Heath: Printed the first test of the case, comparing to radars in lab and documenting changes 
needed to improve design.

Oscar Chavez: Trained a new ML model to use the OOB demo binary. It works well for the gestures we 
already had. When I added the left wave and right wave gesture, the model became very inaccurate. I also 
kept testing ways of getting position data from the Gesture Recognition binary.

Daniel Lu : I created a new mouse moving demo. The new demo is expected to work under noise environment. 
Test during the lab.
